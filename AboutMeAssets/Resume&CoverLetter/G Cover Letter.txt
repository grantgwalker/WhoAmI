Dear Hiring Manager,
I am a passionate software engineer who thrives at the intersection of technology and
human-centered design. With experience in both enterprise and startup environments, I
excel at defining requirements, collaborating across disciplines, and delivering impactful
solutions that improve real-world processes.
At Tektronix, I worked on an internal innovation team focused on modernizing
manufacturing workflows through software solutions. As the sole software developer, I
led projects end-to-end. My team started by identifying process inefficiencies to
designing and deploying user-centered automation tools. My work spanned a range of
technologies, including JavaScript, Java, Thymeleaf, Spring Boot, VBA, RPA,
Copilot, Azure, PowerAutomate and PowerBI. Projects included front-end redesigns
of internal tools, process automation through PowerAutomate and RPA, and data
visualization pipelines. In addition to technical delivery, I mentored three interns,
coordinated project timelines, and led two PowerBI learning cohorts to upskill peers
across departments.
At Machine Research, a software startup, I joined as a full stack developer collaborating
directly with senior engineers, leadership, and cross-functional teams. I developed and
enhanced Angular front-end components using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS,
optimized backend APIs with AWS Amplify, and led schema updates to DynamoDB
that paved the way for additional user functionality. I also mentored an intern,
contributing to both individual and team growth.
At FORCEAI, I utilized my skills to rapidly iterate with agentic coding while analyzing
and verifying the output to build an agent OS. As a full stack developer I designed the
React front end with TypeScript and Tailwind to tailor the users needs and refined the
Python and Rust backend for greater agent-to-agent and agent-to-user communication
reliability. Unfortunately, due to funding issues, the startup could not renew my contract.
Through these roles, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for how thoughtful design and
clear communication enable successful software delivery. I’ve learned to balance
autonomy and collaboration, take initiative in ambiguous environments, and ensure
solutions are both technically sound and user-focused. I’m excited about opportunities
where I can continue building software that makes a tangible difference. I would
welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to your team’s goals.
Sincerely,
Grant Walker
